# Regression-Model-GD-Implementation

### This is my implementation of the Linear Regression Model using Gradient Descent for the optimization of the model.
In the code, i used Numpy to generate dummy data ( x1,x2 ) i.e 2 input features and we have 1 output target.
The code includes some visualization in the end to summarize the performance of the GD using different Learning Rates.
